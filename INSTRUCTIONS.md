QA Automation Assessment
Welcome to the QA Automation assessment. You will be testing a fictional e-commerce application, SauceDemo, to ensure its functionality and user experience are robust.

Challenge
We would like you to write end-to-end (E2E) tests for the SauceDemo application at SauceDemo using Cypress. You have the freedom to choose a design pattern that you believe is suitable for this project. Your design choices will be assessed in the justification phase, so be mindful of your decisions.

Objectives
Technical Skills: Demonstrate your proficiency with Cypress by automating tests for the application.
Prioritization: Show how you prioritize features to test, ensuring the most critical functionalities are covered.
Future-proofing: Illustrate how your framework can be scalable and maintainable for future enhancements.
Documentation: Include detailed documentation on how to set up and run your tests, ensuring that an interdepartmental team can easily follow your instructions.
